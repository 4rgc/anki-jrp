# Japanese Readings and Pitch Accent Add-on

This Anki add-on allows automatically generating readings (furigana) and pitch
accent information for an entire field with a single button press. It can also
convert any amount of cards in bulk.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Anki version 2.1.49 or later installed.
2. On non-Windows platforms only, [install MeCab]() since only a Windows
   executable is bundled with the addon.
3. Install the full version of the add-on
   from [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/TBD).  
   Alternatively, download one of the `.ankiaddon` files from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Ben-Kerman/anki-jrp/releases/latest)
   and install it from file in Anki's add-on menu.  
   The smallest file contains only the addon itself, which means you will need
   to supply your own pitch accent/variant data and install MeCab alongside a
   dictionary for it to use externally.  
   The `full` file has everything, including a MeCab exe for Windows, but you'll
   still have to use your own dictionary for MeCab.  
   The `ipadic` file contains everything the addon needs out of the box and is
   probably what most users will want to install initially.  
   This is also the version shared on AnkiWeb.
4. Restart Anki, open the "Manage Note Types" menu (`Ctrl`+`â‡§`+`N`) and set up
   your templates as described [here]().
5. Open the add-on's preferences under "Tools", go the "Note Types" tab, then
   select and click "Add" for all note types you set up in the previous step.  
   If you previously used the Migaku Japanese Add-on with any note type
   click `Remove MIA/Migaku` in its section, otherwise this add-on will not work
   properly.
6. Save your preferences. You should now be able to preview or review any cards
   that contain reading/accent syntax with furigana and accent coloring /
   indicators.

## Adding Readings and Pitch Accent Information

### Individual

To generate or remove readings and accent info for a single note, select it in
the Anki browser, focus the field you want to change and click one of the
conversion buttons at the right of the editor toolbar (or press the associated
shortcut).

### Bulk Conversion

The _Notes_ entry in the browser's menu bar contains an action for converting
notes in bulk. Select any notes you want to change, choose the bulk conversion
action from the menu bar, adjust the configuration dialog to what you want and
click _Convert_. All notes need to be of the same note type, since it wouldn't
be possible to determine the target field otherwise.

With the _Default_ and _Migaku_ conversion types, any notes that already contain
reading/accent syntax will be converted directly to the closest equivalent in
the target syntax without regenerating (unless the corresponding option is
checked), or left unchanged if the existing syntax type is the same as the
target.

If you're converting large amounts of notes, such as sentence mining decks
containing hundreds or thousands of cards, make sure to back everything up
before running the conversion. Exporting the deck(s) with scheduling information
(but without media, since the conversion only changes the notes themselves)
should be sufficient.
